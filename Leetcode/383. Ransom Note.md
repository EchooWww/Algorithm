## 383. Ransom Note
 Given two strings ransomNote and magazine, return true if ransomNote can be constructed by using the letters from magazine and false otherwise.

Each letter in magazine can only be used once in ransomNote.

 

Example 1:

Input: ransomNote = "a", magazine = "b"
Output: false
Example 2:

Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "ab"
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "aab"
Output: true
 

Constraints:

1 <= ransomNote.length, magazine.length <= 105
ransomNote and magazine consist of lowercase English letters.

> Thinking Process:
1. Can be resolves with maps, the key to be the character and the value to be the occurence
2. But the more concise way is an array with length 26 to track all 26 letters, and use character subtraction for the index

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canConstruct(String ransomNote, String magazine) {
        int[] char_occur = new int[26];
        for(char c: magazine.toCharArray()) {
            char_occur[c-'a'] += 1;
        }
        for (char c: ransomNote.toCharArray()) {
            if (char_occur[c-'a'] == 0) return false;
            else char_occur[c-'a'] -= 1;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
